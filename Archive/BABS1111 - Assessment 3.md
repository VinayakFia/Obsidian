### Analysis
##### Purpose of healthy individual's samples
The purpose of running the glucose concentration experiment on a healthy individual is to confirm the experiment's accuracy. For the experiment to be valid, the healthy individuals glucose levels must fall within the reference glucose range.

The fasting glucose concentration of the healthy person tested, $4.91 mmol/L$, lies within the normal range of $4-6 mmol/L$ (StatPearls Publishing LLC 2023). The healthy person's glucose levels at $120 minutes$ of $5.77 mmol/L$ also falls well within the reference glucose concentration range $≤7.8$ at $120 minutes$ recommended by RCPA.

Since the healthy person's glucose concentration are within the expected range, the experiment is valid.
##### Diagnosis
**Alice's glucose levels are normal**. Her fasting glucose level of $4.86 mmol/L$ is within the normal range of $4-6 mmol/L$ (StatPearls Publishing LLC 2023). Additionally, her glucose levels at $120 minutes$ of $5.89 mmol/L$ are within the reference healthy glucose concentration of $≤7.8$ at $120 minutes$. As such, Alice most likely **does not have diabetes**.

Alice also took a blood test earlier, where the result indicated that Alice had *high triclyceride levels*. This indicate that Alice may (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 2023) not get enough exercise, eat too many foods that are high in fat, and/or drink too much alcohol. These sources will be further investigated in the analysis of Alice's food and activity record.
## Question 2 (28 marks)
### Health Statistics and General Health (8 marks)
##### Daily Energy Requirement
Using the recommended [daily energy requirements calculator](https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/nutrition-calculators/daily-energy-requirements-calculator) and Alice's given details, we can determine that her daily energy requirement is approximately $10,400kJ$.

Alice's dietary record indicates that she consumes $9,370kJ$ per day. This is lower than the recommended daily energy intake of $10,400kJ$. Alice's physical activity record indicates that Alice expends on average $9,540kJ$ every day. As such Alice is in an energy deficit of $9540kJ - 9370kJ = 170kJ$. Since Alice is in an energy deficit, she **is losing weight**.
##### Should she gain, lose, or maintain weight and why?
 > [!info] BMI 
 > BMI is a measure of whether your weight is in a healthy range for your height (Heart Foundation). $BMI = \frac{weight \times 10,000}{(height ^ 2)}$
 
To estimate whether Alice should be aiming to lose, gain or maintain weight, we will use her BMI measurement. We can do this using the formula above or simply using an online calculator such as [heart foundation's](https://www.heartfoundation.org.au/bmi-calculator). Using Alice's details, we calculate that Alice's BMI = $28.5$.

BMI is not an accurate measurement of health for individuals of particular ethnic groups, pregnancy, or athletic status. However, Alice does not fall into any of these categories and as such we can use her BMI as an indicator of her health.

Alice's BMI  in is the overweight range of $25-29.9$ (Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care 2021). **Alice should aim to decrease her weight to approximately $64kg$ or less.**
### About the Diet (10 marks)
#### Macronutrient Intake
***fig 5. Recommended macronutrient intake, derived from (Eat for health Australia)**

| **Macronutrient** | **Approximate Recommended Intake (% of total energy)** | **Alice's average intake** |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Fat               | 20-35                                                  | 49.65                      |
| Protein           | 20-22*                                                 | 16.97                      |
| Carbohydrate      | 40-65                                                  | 42.56                      |
> *\* Protein intake is particularly variable. A clear recommendation is not made, however the range from 20-22% is good for most people.*

**Alice has greater than recommended fat intake.** Alice should reduce her fat intake and consume foods higher in proteins and carbohydrates.

Alice consumes many good foods in her diet, such as the *creamy chicken pasta* and *her lunch on day 3* which contains a  distribution of macronutrients that aligns with the recommendations.

However, Alice also consumes foods that are low in nutrient quality and high in fat, such as
- KFC Zinger Burger
- KFC Double Tender Burger
- KFC Chocolate Mousse
- Half rack of BBQ Pork Ribs
- World Kitchen Garlic Bread Slices
- Kit Kat
- Hot chocolate
- Tiramisu
- Butter
#### Is Alice eating enough meals?
How many meals a day an individual has and their spacing can be quite varied with different schedules working for different people due to their lifestyles. Alice is eating enough meals here.
#### Meeting calorie requirements
Alice is currently in a calorie deficit, this means she is eating less than the recommended intake for her height and weight. We determined earlier that Alice should be aiming to lose weight to around $64kg$, so a calorie deficit is not an issue here, and instead will be a necessary for Alice to reach a healthier weight.
#### Concerns related to the diet journal
It is not an issue for Alice to consume snack foods that have a worse macronutrient composition, such as hot chocolates, kit kat, and tiramisu. Although these foods have high fat content, something Alice needs to cut down on, they do not contribute to Alice's total fat intake as significantly as her main meals.

The primary concern regarding Alice's diet, is her consumption of highly processed foods, and fast foods. This is particularly clear on day 3, where fat contributed to $44\%$ of Alice's energy intake for the day. A major contributor to this was the KFC dinner she had. On other days, she had a fat intake of approximately $38\%$, which is far closer to the maximum recommended fat intake of $35\%$.
#### Recommended changes to the diet
A precise recommendation for dietary changes requires understanding Alice's lifestyle, commitments, mental health, physical health, and more. We can piece some of this together from her activity log, from which we can make some recommendations:
- Spend time used for activities such as *Lying in bed on the computer* on home-cooked meals. Home cooked meals tend to be lower in fat, less processed, and have a positive mental health impact for many. Working with Alice to find some healthy recipes she could try could go a long way in helper her reduce her fat intake.
- Reduce intake of fast-foods. It is clear from analysing Alice's diet that fast foods are a major contributor to her fat intake.
- Structuring meals. I notice on *day 3*, Alice's worst day in terms of fat intake, was a day where she did not have a satiating breakfast. A strategy Alice could try is to consume larger home-cooked breakfasts as it may reduce the likelihood of fast-food cravings later in the day.
### About Activities (10 marks)
#### What type of activities does Alice carry out daily? Is it incidental or athletic? What’s the difference and why does it matter?
The majority of activities carried out by Alice are incidental in nature, such as cleaning and other household chores. Nearly all activities besides *doing an exercise video (light effort)* are incidental activities.

Although performing many high MET value incidental activities is a good thing, Alice is missing out on the benefits of purposeful exercise. These include:
- Lengthened lifespan
- Improved mental health and wellbeing
- Improve blood sugar and insulin levels
- Improved quality of sleep
- Improved brain function and memory
#### Refer to specific examples and MET values from the journal to what you consider to be good/bad activity choices and why.

| **Activity**                 | **Good/Bad** | **Reason**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Doing an exercise video      | good         | This is great as it expends more energy, and provides Alice with many of the benefits of exercise mentioned earlier                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Walking the dog              | good         | Same as above but also get's Alice out of the house which is likely a contributor to improved mental health                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Lying in bed on the computer | bad          | This is an activity that doesn't contribute to Alice's energy expenditure. Additionally, screen time and blue light, particularly before bed, can hinder sleep (Sleep Foundation).<br><br>Further, it contributes over 2 hours to Alice's time spent daily, leading to 2 hours of minimal energy expenditure. |
| Sitting and watching TV      | bad          | Same as above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
#### What type of activities contribute mostly to energy out?
These are almost always *Lying in bed on the computer*, *Sitting at the desk working*, and *Sleeping*. These are all incidental activities with low MET values and energy expenditure.
#### Is she getting enough sleep? Why does sleep contribute to a lot of energy expenditure?
**Yes**, Alice is getting enough sleep. She sleep approximately 9 hours daily which is well above the minimum recommendation of 7 hours (Sleep Foundation).

Alice performs no activities of a high MET value, as such, the activity she spends the greatest times on are the ones that contribute the most to her energy expenditure.
#### Do you have any recommended changes to her activities?
Alice should take away time spent lying in bed on her laptop and replace it with some purposeful and structured exercise. The exercise depends on Alice and her goals, but some recommendations include:
- Running/ Jogging (MET=6.0). half an hour of running would be $216kcal$
- Resistance Training (MET=3.5), an hour of resistance training would be $252kcal$
- Joining some form of sport, this would not only be quality physical activity, but could also support mental health through social interaction
## Question 3 (10 marks)
### Food
My diet consists of a majority home-cooked meals with protein supplements. Example of foods consumed in the last 3 days include:

| **Food**                               | **Protein (est)** | **Carbohydrates** | **Fat** |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- |
| Rajma Chawal and Dahi (Indian Yoghurt) | 21.1              | 48.3              | 10.2    |
| Protein Shake with Milk                | 40                | 33                | 11      |
| Veggie Sandwich from Plume             | ~8                | ~25.2             | ~9      |
| Oats, weetbix, milk and wheat cereals  | 9.3               | 42.1              | 8.3     |
Although the majority of my diet is relatively healthy and well balanced, I do on average once or twice a week consume un-healthier restaurant meals. These are often far higher in fats and lower in nutrients. Overall, my food consumption is more balanced than Alice's where my daily macronutrient intake is in line with recommendations in *fig 5*.
### Activity
Unfortunately, most of my time is spent at my desk (approximately 10-11 hours a day). This would have a MET value of $1.7$ as I tend to fidget, move in my chair, stand up, and walk around occasionally during this activity. Across my whole day I usually have about $10,000$ steps and $140$ minutes of movement (according to my phone), although this can often vary as high as $20,000$ or as low as $6,000$. In addition to these incidental activities, I also perform resistance training for approximately 50 minutes 3 days a week.

In comparison to Alice, I also have a lot of the low MET value activities she does, such as sitting and working. However, I incorporate more walking, and perform resistance training. These intentional and structured athletic activities contribute not only to my daily energy expenditure, but also increase my basal metabolic rate. This is because as I continue to exercise, I will gain skeletal muscles, which have a greater specific resting metabolic rate of $13kcal/kg/day$ compared to adipose tissue which as $4.5kcal/kg/day$.
### Sleep
I sleep approximately 7.5 hours daily, which is above the minimum recommended amount. It may be better for me to sleep for greater lengths like Alice to improve mental and physical recovery. My quality of sleep may also be suffering similar to Alice's due to blue light exposure preceding sleep.
### Improvements
Improvements I can make include
- Decreasing blue-light exposure and screen time close to sleep.
- Decreasing time spent sitting throughout the day. This is not something I can realistically change until I graduate.
- Increasing cardio activities. Although I weight train, this does not build endurance, nor burn as much energy as cardio.
- Greater consistency with food. Although throughout the week I believe I have consumed the right about of macronutrients on average, there are days where my fat or carb intake is too high due to eating out, or stress eating.
