## SCATS - Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System

I propose to model a traffic light system based on SCATS. The traffic light system will run on a common, *small* intersection setup as below:

We have several key components here:

| Name                  | Count                                             | States                                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic Light         | 4                                                 | For simplicity, I have decided to settle on a traffic light with only three states: Red, amber, and green. |
| Pedestrian Light      | 4                                                 | These will have 2 states, Red and Green.                                                                   |
| Pedestrian(s) Present | 8 (can be simplified to 4, one for each crossing) | These will have 2 states, present, and not present.                                                        |
| Car Sensor            | 4                                                 | These will have 2 states, present, and not present.                                                        |
|                       |                                                   |                                                                                                            |
