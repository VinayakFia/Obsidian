## stream a reflection
I believe that my specification was quite complex, however, after implementing, there were several simplifications made. These simpli

## self-assessment
I did not complete all HD tasks (e.g. stream B HD was not 100% completed), however, I made a strong attempt at all tasks regardless of grade, and did complete HD tasks for Stream A. I also did spend many many hours learning and programming promela, and made my system effectively. I did have to change my implementation from using signals to using shared arrays, however this did not change the important states, and importantly actually worked.

I believe that this lines up with a low HD (85-90) or a higher D (80-90).

## reflections on the unit
Through this unit, I have learnt how to model systems in promela, model real life systems with structures, design and evaluate CTL/LTL formulae, and much more. I've developed my ability to self-learn, and learn from formatif feedback. Overall, this has been a very interesting course, and I hope to do more research and study of formal verification in my free time in the future.
