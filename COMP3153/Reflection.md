## self-assessment
I did not complete all HD tasks (e.g. stream B HD was not 100% completed), however, I made a strong attempt at all tasks regardless of grade, and did complete HD tasks for Stream A. I believe that this lines up with a low HD (85-90) or a high D (80-90).

## reflections on the unit
Through this unit, I have learnt how to model systems in promela, model real life systems with structures, design and evaluate CTL/LTL formulae, and much more. I've developed my ability to self-learn, and learn from formatif feedback.
