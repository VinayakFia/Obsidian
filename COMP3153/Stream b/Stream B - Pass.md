## B.2
1. **XX**b
Not satisfied. Consider $q_0$ -> $q_1$ -> $q_2$, where $q_2$ does not have $b$ in its proposition set.
2. a**U**c
This is satisfied because the only 2 states with $c$ are $q2, q5$. When reaching $q2$, we must come from $q1$, which has $a$ in its proposition set. When reaching $q5$, we must come from $q2$, which also has $a$ in its proposition set set. So, regardless of how we reach a state with $c$ in its proposition set, we will have satisfied $a$ on the way.
