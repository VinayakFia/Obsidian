## B.2
**Part a**
1. **XX**b, that is, after 2 steps we reach a state with $b$ in its proposition set
Not satisfied. Consider $q_0$ -> $q_1$ -> $q_2$, where $q_2$ does not have $b$ in its proposition set.
2. a**U**c, that is, $a$ is satisfied on until we reach $c$
This is satisfied because the only 2 states with $c$ are $q2, q5$. When reaching $q2$, we must come from $q1$, which has $a$ in its proposition set. When reaching $q5$, we must come from $q2$, which also has $a$ in its proposition set set. So, regardless of how we reach a state with $c$ in its proposition set, we will have satisfied $a$ on the way.
3. **GF**b, that is, $b$ occurs infinitely often.
This is satisfied, it can be seen by noting that $q4$ is part of every cycle and will always eventually be reached. As such $b$ will occur infinitely often.

**Part b**
1. **AXEX**b
