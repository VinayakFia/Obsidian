## B.1
$$\alpha\textbf{B}_1\beta ≡ (¬\alpha ∧ ¬\beta) \textbf{U} (\alpha ∧ \textbf{X}((¬\alpha ∧ ¬\beta) \textbf{U} \beta))$$
$$\forall n > 1, a\textbf{B}_nb \equiv \textbf{F}(a \wedge \textbf{XB}_{n-1})$$

**Proof**
**Base case**
$\alpha\textbf{B}_1\beta ≡ (¬\alpha ∧ ¬\beta) \textbf{U} (\alpha ∧ \textbf{X}((¬\alpha ∧ ¬\beta) \textbf{U} \beta))$

Firstly lets see

**Inductive case**
Assumption, $aB_nb$ is the operator that specifies that $a$ holds true exactly $n$ times before $b$ holds true.

We have $aB_{n+1}b \equiv \textbf{F}a \wedge a \implies B_{n}$. That is, $a$ occurs eventually and $a$ implies that $a$ holds true exactly $n$ times before $b$ holds true. So we have that $aB_{n+1}b$ is equivalent to $a$ occurring $n+1$ times before $b$ holds true.

Algorithm:
$$\phi \wedge \varphi = \text{if } b_1 \text{ then } \phi_1 \wedge \varphi_1 \text{ else } \phi_2 \wedge \varphi_2$$
We know that these are $OBDD$'s and not $ROBDD$'s, so we can assume that they are full at all levels. If the n'th level has $w_a$ nodes, then $w_a = $
