#### Part A
> For all n, exactly one of An or Bn satisfies the LTL formula: $FGp$. With justification, which structure(s) do and which structures do not?

Consider $A_0$:

Lets call the node on the left $q_0$ and the node on the right $q_1$. We may go on the infinite cycle $q_0 \rightarrow q_1 \rightarrow q_0 \rightarrow q_1 ...$ . Here the requirement $\textbf{FG}p$, that is, *eventually $p$ will always be satisfied is not help*.

Consider $B$, lets start with the base case $
