## Requirement 1
Perpendicular lights should not be on at the same time. This requires multiple LTL formulas to capture. Let
1. $\alpha$ mean that light 1 is on
2. $\beta$ mean that light 2 is on
We have the LTL formula:
$$\textbf{G}(\neg(\alpha \wedge \beta))$$
That is, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will never be true simultaneously.
