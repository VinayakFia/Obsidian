> How might fairness, accountability, and transparency be achieved collectively by an automated decision - that is - by a decision outputted by an AI? In your answer, compare and contrast a causal account of explanation with at least one other account of explanation. Make explicit reference to the reading (and references therein) for Thursday of Week 4.

## Possible Thesis

1. Why are we worried about accountability, fairness and transparency
	1. Intentions/ decisions are based upon beliefs/desires
	2. Accountability, fairness and transparency are properties upon a decision
	3. A decision is accountable if it is explicable
	4. Decisions may be explained through an agen't beliefs and desires
	5. A decision is fair if its explination is nomatively salient
	6. Normative salience is a property on an explanation or reason that identifies that a decision aligns with ethical standards
	7. a decision is transparent if its explanation is reportable and accessible.
	8. Humans are partial to causal explanation
	9. Human decision making is accepted by its accountability, fairness and transparency
2. ADM
	1. What is ADM
	2. What makes a decision fair, accountable and transparent
	3. ADM through causal does not work
		1. COMPAS recidivism
		2. LLM detection
		3. Specifically discus the shortcomings

### 2.1 Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent model
Grayson approaches human decision making through the belief/ desire psychological model. A parallel and largely similar model is the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent model developed by Michael Bratman to reason human decisions. **CHECK THIS**

### 2.2 Accountability
Borrowing from Grayson, we identify that accountability requires reasons (Grayson 2024 p5). It is because a decision may be explained that it is accountable.
