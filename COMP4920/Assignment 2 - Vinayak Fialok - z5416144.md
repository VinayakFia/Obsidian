> How might fairness, accountability, and transparency be achieved collectively by an automated decision - that is - by a decision outputted by an AI? In your answer, compare and contrast a causal account of explanation with at least one other account of explanation. Make explicit reference to the reading (and references therein) for Thursday of Week 4.

## Possible Thesis

1. Why are we worried about accountability, fairness and transparency
	1. Intentions/ decisions are based upon beliefs/desires
	2. Accountability, fairness and transparency are properties upon a decision
	3. A decision is accountable if it is explicable
	4. Decisions may be explained through an agen't beliefs and desires
	5. A decision is fair if its explination is nomatively salient
	6. Normative salience is a property on an explanation or reason that identifies that a decision aligns with ethical standards
	7. a decision is transparent if its explanation is reportable and accessible.
	8. Humans are partial to causal explanation
	9. Human decision making is accepted by its accountability, fairness and transparency
2. ADM
	1. What is ADM
	2. What makes a decision fair, accountable and transparent
	3. ADM through causal does not work
		1. COMPAS recidivism
		2. LLM detection
		3. Specifically discus the shortcomings

## 2.1. Accountability, Fairness, and Transparency
Accountability, fairness and transparency are properties of a decision. Firstly, let's define what these properties mean.

Borrowing from Grayson, we identify that accountability requires reasons. That is, an accountable decision is one that is reasonable. Reasonableness is a function of normatively rational salience (Grayson 2024 p5). For a reason to be normatively salient, a reason must be considered grounded in norms or morally "right" or "fair" within a given context. So we derive our property of fairness as possessing reasons that are considered morally salient. A decisions reasonableness also requires reportability, that is the reasons for a decision must also be understandable and accessible to its stakeholders. So we have our last derived property of transparency which refers to the reportability of our decision. Lets finally define that a decision that collectively achieves fairness, accountability and transparency is acceptable.

The question of *How might fairness, accountability, and transparency be achieved collectively by an automated decision* may then be phrased as "How might an automated decision provide reasons that are ethical in a transparent manner". To understand the notion of reasoning, lets explore how Grayson argues human decisions are reasonable and transparent.

### 2.2. Human Decision Making
// TODO: intro para
To discuss how AI may make acceptable decisions, lets first understand how humans may do so. Through the belief-desire-intention model and counterfactual causal reasoning, humans are capable of making decisions that are fair and transparent, and as such accountable and acceptable.

Grayson explore human decision making through the a model mirroring the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent model developed by Michael Bratman. Beliefs are the set of true statements understood by the agent, such as "there is coffee in the fridge". Desires are an agent's goals, preferences and values, such as "I feel groggy and tired". Beliefs and desires are independent of each other. An intention is a plan, scheme or strategy formed in pursuit of an agent's desires, and based upon an agent's beliefs. The coexistence of the aforementioned belief and desire, and the lack of opposing desires such as "I want to stay in bed", would culminate in the intention of "I will go to the kitchen and drink coffee". This line of reasoning naturally aligns itself with causal reasoning. More specifically Grayson discusses counterfactual causal reasoning, which for the above situation would be phrased as "if I had not believed coffee lie in the fridge and I did not feel tired, then I would not have gone to get coffee". By explaining a decision through beliefs and desires, a human can be transparent about a decision. Following, beliefs and desires that are normatively salient makes a decision fair.

### 2.3. Reasoning to Explanation
Reasoning is the process in which a human or machine come to a decision. An explanation is the conveying of our reasoning to others. We can think of the . This process is direct for human decision making as the parameters of the decision, that is the beliefs and desires of an individual, are easy to. It is intuitive to convey beliefs and desires, and then through causal explanation, counterfactual or otherwise, convey that through one's beliefs and desires, they have made a decision.

Suppose

### 2.1 Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent model
Grayson approaches human decision making through the belief/ desire psychological model. A parallel and largely similar model is the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent model developed by Michael Bratman to reason human decisions. **CHECK THIS**

### 2.2 Accountability
Borrowing from Grayson, we identify that accountability requires reasons (Grayson 2024 p5). It is because a decision may be explained that it is accountable.
