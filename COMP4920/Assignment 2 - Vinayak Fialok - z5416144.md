> How might fairness, accountability, and transparency be achieved collectively by an automated decision - that is - by a decision outputted by an AI? In your answer, compare and contrast a causal account of explanation with at least one other account of explanation. Make explicit reference to the reading (and references therein) for Thursday of Week 4.

## Possible Thesis

1. Why are we worried about accountability, fairness and transparency
	1. Intentions/ decisions are based upon beliefs/desires
	2. Accountability, fairness and transparency are properties upon a decision
	3. A decision is accountable if it is explicable
	4. Decisions may be explained through an agen't beliefs and desires
	5. A decision is fair if its explination is nomatively salient
	6. Normative salience is a property on an explanation or reason that identifies that a decision aligns with ethical standards
	7. a decision is transparent if its explanation is reportable and accessible.
	8. Humans are partial to causal explanation
	9. Human decision making is accepted by its accountability, fairness and transparency
2. ADM
	1. What is ADM
	2. What makes a decision fair, accountable and transparent
	3. ADM through causal does not work
		1. COMPAS recidivism
		2. LLM detection
		3. Specifically discus the shortcomings

## 2.2. Accountability, Fairness, and Transparency
Accountability, fairness and transparency are properties of a decision. Firstly, let's define what these properties mean.

Borrowing from Grayson, we identify that accountability requires reasons. That is, an accountable decision is one that is reasonable. Reasonableness is a function of normatively rational salience (Grayson 2024 p5). For a reason to be normatively salient, a reason must be considered grounded in norms or morally "right" or "fair" within a given context. So we derive our property of fairness as possessing reasons that are considered morally salient. A decisions reasonableness also requires reportability, that is the reasons for a decision must also be understandable and accessible to its stakeholders. So we have our last derived property of transparency which refers to the reportability of our decision. Lets finally define that an acceptable decision is accountable, and so it is fair and transparent.

TODO: maybe define why these are important

## 2.3 Reasonableness
Reasonableness is at the centre of a decision's acceptability. But, how may we reason 

### 2.1 Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agent model
Grayson approaches human decision making through the belief/ desire psychological model. A parallel and largely similar model is the belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent model developed by Michael Bratman to reason human decisions. **CHECK THIS**

Beliefs are the set of true statements understood by the agent, such as "there is coffee in the fridge". Desires are an agent's goals, preferences and values, such as "I feel groggy and tired". Beliefs and desires are independent of each other. An intention is a plan, scheme or strategy formed in pursuit of an agent's desires, and based upon an agent's beliefs. The coexistence of the aforementioned belief and desire, and the lack of opposing desires such as "I want to stay in bed", would culminate in the intention of "I will go to the kitchen and drink coffee".
### 2.2 Accountability
Borrowing from Grayson, we identify that accountability requires reasons (Grayson 2024 p5). It is because a decision may be explained that it is accountable.
