### 1. Introduction
Achieving the properties of accountability, fairness and transparency is essential to acceptable Automated Decision Making (ADM), particularly for the critical life-changing ADM system of recidivism prediction. We argue that COMPAS, a recidivism prediction software, may achieve transparency through simplification of its internal reasoning without lack of accuracy. However, the essential property of accuracy is not sufficiently achieved to result in fairness, particularly through the effect of automation bias.
