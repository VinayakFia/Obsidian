> [!info] Expound and assess rule-based/Kantian ethics. Analyse the extent to which such an ethics might be used to design an automated ethics as per the readings in section 1.2 below. What do you think that the risks and opportunities of such an automated ethics might be? Why? Justify your answer with explicit, detailed, expositional reference to at least one of the suggested readings in section 1.2 below.

## Draft 1
Kantian ethics is a deontological ethical framework based upon the concept of the categorical imperative. Kantian ethics is pragmatic and effective for the modern individual to apply in daily life, and serves as an effective tool for organisations of any size to make decisions regarding the ethicality of regulation and law. The extent to which ethics can be automated refers to the amount of the ethical decision making process that may be handled by a machine. Kantian ethics cannot be automated to the extent of requiring no human interaction, which I will refer to as complete automation, as it fundamentally violates the categorical imperative. Complete automation provides great opportunity for efficiency gains, specifically in situation where human deliberation is time consuming. However, such applications pose incredible risk to those affected including the loss of life in weapons systems and punishment/ reward in organisations. Kantian ethics can be automated to the extent of a proof assistant. Such automation provides the opportunity to alleviate the burden of proving maxims with no risk. 

Kantian ethics is based on concept of the categorical imperative, which, in its first formulation states that one must act only according to maxims that they wish to become universal law (Kant 2008 p11). Each act represents one or more maxims, and one must formulate such maxims by deleting references to supplementary details such as places, times, or persons (O'Neill 1985 p161). Then, one must reason whether said maxims ought to be universal law, that is, it ought to be moral and acted upon by all. Suppose a moral agent was considering lying to their friend about attending their birthday, they may reduce this act to 'I ought to lie'. Then, rationalising that certainly they would not wish a world where lying be moral, they would conclude that lying to their friend is immoral.

Kant, in his second formulation, states that we must never treat humans as a mere means, but always at the same time an end (Kant 2008 p29). As O'Neil expounds, to use someone as a mere means is to involve them in a scheme of action to which they could not in principle consent (O’Neill, 1986). The earlier proposed scheme of lying could indeed not be consented to by the deceived party, as the consenting party is unaware of the real maxim.

Kantian ethics provides a effective framework for the modern individual to rationalise actions, although requires great, and perhaps impractical, nuance to reason certain situations. Unlike utilitarianism's infinite computation of the hedonic calculus, one may reasonably form maxims, and reason the universality of each in a sensible amount of time. Similarly, one may consider the human dignity, autonomy, and respect of involved parties. Critics argue that there exist certain situations, such as the axe murderer problem referenced in Kant's essay 'On the Supposed Right to Lie', where a moral agent must take moral action that results in negative consequences. However, modern Kantian ethicists argue that doing so would violate one's self-respect, as one becomes a 'tool for evil' (Korsgaard 1986 p340). Such situations required such great nuance that Kantian ethics may well be difficult to reason.

Kantian ethics enables organisations and governments to make pragmatic decisions that respect all involved parties. Kantian ethics requires that one respect each individual as a rational person with their own maxims. One may also seek to foster others’ plans and maxims by sharing some of their ends (O'Neill 1983 p162). Through Kantian ethics, organisations can ensure that rules, decisions, and actions taken may at least be 'in principal consent(ed) to' by all involved parties. For example, the Kantian views abortion to have moral considerations against it, but sometimes permissible, and sometimes even required (Denis 2008 p117). As such, a society with laws based upon Kantian ethics would see abortion's ban as impermissible, but equally respect those who based upon their own ends did see it as such.

Complete automation of Kantian ethics, regardless of implementation, is incompatible with Kant's formulations of the categorical imperative. Kant's formula of humanity (FH) - specifically to treat individuals as ends in themselves never as a mere means - requires that the persons capable of moral evaluation must be considered as ends in themselves (Nath, R., and Sahu, V. 2021). This gives rise to the question: can we consider artificial moral agents as ends in themselves? As argued by Weizenbaum, 'computer intelligence is alien to genuine human problems and concerns'. Indeed, there are several critical lacking functions artificial intelligence is unable to replicate, such as intuition, discretion, and instinct. The inability for artificial intelligence to acquire such features lead them to be incapable of moral action. Moreover, any implementation of a Kantian artificial moral agent follows procedures that ultimately reduce it to a hypothetical moral agent. (Manna, Nath 2021: 144). These systems perform actions based on their instructions, and as such can only be amoral.

To the extent of a proof assistance, Kantian ethics may effectively be implemented, and moreover be used to aid in formally reasoning the morality of maxims. As demonstrated by Lavanya Singh, who builds upon prior research in the field of ethical automation; Kantian ethics can be formalised into the rigorous semantics of proof languages such as Isabelle. Indeed Singh demonstrates proof of maxims pertaining to ethical dilemmas such as lying, or the morality of joking. However, the critical step of forming the 'maxim' of an action seems quite indeterminable (Kitcher 2003). Singh adopts O'Niell's view that maxims are composed of the act, circumstance, and goal (Singh 2022). Although this serves as a more sophisticated guide for a moral agent to procure maxims, several maxims may still apply to a single action. So, the burden falls upon the user of an ethical proof system to conceive of sophisticated assumptions, maxims, and specifications. To the extent of formally verifying human procured maxims, automation is highly viable, and effective. Such automation serves as a valuable  opportunity for organisations to ethically rectify complex moral decisions, such as those in relation to regulation and law making.

Kantian ethics is an effective foundation for rationalising decisions. However, its distinct lack of human qualities required of a moral agent make it unsuitable for complete automation. Kantian proof systems in contrast may serve as effective tools for humans to formalise the morality of maxims.
