> [!info] Expound and assess rule-based/Kantian ethics. Analyse the extent to which such an ethics might be used to design an automated ethics as per the readings in section 1.2 below. What do you think that the risks and opportunities of such an automated ethics might be? Why? Justify your answer with explicit, detailed, expositional reference to at least one of the suggested readings in section 1.2 below.

## Draft 1

Specifically, Kantian ethics is based on concept of the *categorical imperative*, which, in its first formulation states that one must act only according to maxims that they wish to become universal law. Each act represents one or more maxims, and one must formulate such maxims by deleting references to supplementary details such as places, times, or persons. Then, one must reason whether said maxims ought to be universal law, that is, it ought to be moral and acted upon by all. Suppose a moral agent was considering lying to their friend about attending their birthday, they may reduce this act to 'I ought to lie'. Then, rationalising that certainly they would not wish a world where lying be moral, they would conclude that lying to their friend is immoral.

Kant states that we must never treat humans as a mere means, but always at the same time an end. As O'Neil expounds, to use someone as a mere means is to involve them in a scheme of action to which they could not in principle consent (O’Neill, 1986). The earlier proposed scheme of lying could indeed not be consented to by the deceived party.

A key

**Assess Kantian ethics**
Unlike Utilitarianism's impractical computation of the hedonic calculus, one may reasonably utilise Kantian ethics to rationalise moral decisions in everyday life. Moreover, the emphasis on the individual's "will that it (a maxim) should become universal law" accounts for variance in individual preference.

Let us cover a common critique of Kant. Suppose one must lie to save a life, as a murder has arrived at your doorstep asking for your boss. A Kantian moral agent must tell the truth. However, this radical simplification of a situation to a unrealistic dichotomy is not reflective of reality[^1]. A moral agent has many possible moral actions to take. For example, it may be a better action to not answer, call security, or to try to reason with them. Indeed one may be forced to make the harder, but moral, choice over the easy one. Yet, this brings us to what is a true limitation of Kantian ethics, the inability to identify the best action. Kantian ethics is black and white, either something is moral, or it is immoral. As such, given situations where there are several moral actions, one must derive their own logic to decide which is best.

Overall, Kantian ethics is a pragmatic framework for the individual to make rational, *right*, decisions.
