> [!info] Expound and assess rule-based/Kantian ethics. Analyse the extent to which such an ethics might be used to design an automated ethics as per the readings in section 1.2 below. What do you think that the risks and opportunities of such an automated ethics might be? Why? Justify your answer with explicit, detailed, expositional reference to at least one of the suggested readings in section 1.2 below.

## Draft 1
**Expound**
Specifically, Kantian ethics is based on concept of the *categorical imperative*, which, in its first formulation states that one must act only according to maxims that they wish to become universal law. Each act represents one or more maxims, and one must formulate such maxims by deleting references to supplementary details such as places, times, or persons. Then, one must reason whether said maxims ought to be universal law, that is, it ought to be moral and acted upon by all. Suppose a moral agent was considering lying to their friend about attending their birthday, they may reduce this act to 'I ought to lie'. Then, rationalising that certainly they would not wish a world where lying be moral, they would conclude that lying to their friend is immoral.

Kant states that we must never treat humans as a mere means, but always at the same time an end. As O'Neil expounds, to use someone as a mere means is to involve them in a scheme of action to which they could not in principle consent (O’Neill, 1986). The earlier proposed scheme of lying could indeed not be consented to by the deceived party.

**Good**
**REWORD**
Kantian ethics provides a practical framework for the modern individual to rationalise actions. Unlike utilitarianism's infinite computation of the hedonic calculus, one may reasonably form maxims, and reason the universality of each. Further Kantian ethics' uniquely considers the individual's preference, leading to an ethical framework consistent with the diversity of beliefs in the 21st century. Ultimately deciding whether one chooses a maxim to become universal law is based on their own will. As such, each person, when considering their own actions, is free to choose their morality. Moreover, the actions of others, regardless of one's own beliefs, must also be respected, as one must respect human rationality.
