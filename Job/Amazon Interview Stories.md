**1. Tutoring resources** A TIER
- Situation
	- Tutoring OOP at UNSW. I noticed after my first tutorial that students did not feel engaged, and had not completely learnt all the content I had covered in class. I also felt that the given resources were not the best examples of using OOP, and it wasn't clear why a more complicated OOP solution would be used over if or switch statements.
- Task
	- Even though I had run my tutorial as was taught to me in training sessions, I felt that I was not satisfied with my teaching, and I needed to engage my class my class more.
- Action
	- For the following weeks, I researched the patterns I would teach, and found ways of teaching I felt were easier to understand, and more intuitively lead to the desired pattern. I wanted my students to feel like they were discovering the pattern themselves.
	- One example was teaching the decorator pattern. I implemented an armour system for Minecraft with many obvious and subtle code smells. I would ask students what code smells there are and how they could be improved and we would slowly work towards a system that used the decorator pattern. I would then formally explain the decorator pattern.
- Result
	- Tutorials become much more interactive. Students were more engaged and better understood the content. I had great feedback as well.

**2. Workshops Overcommital** B TIER
- Situation
	- As a director at compclub, I was responsible for creating resources for high school workshops. For one of our workshops, I had overcommited myself and my team to a complex project involving pygame which internals team had proposed and required to be completed within only 2 weeks. We were coming up the the deadline, and internals team needed the solution code to be completed in order to create their presentation materials.
- Task
	- I needed to make sure that the solution code, starter code, and instructions were done before the weekend, and that internals had ac
- Action
	- I organised an in person bonding and development day with my subcom. We spent about 5 hours together at uni working on these tasks whilst also talking and catching up. By making this a fun experience, the whole team was more excited to learn and work on this project. In the end, we weren't able to complete everything by the end, however, enough was completed for me and my co-director to jointly complete the remaining tasks within a few hours the following day.
- Result
	- In the end, everything had been completed and deployed in time for the work shop. From this, we learnt that 2 weeks is insufficient time for
