**1. Tutoring resources**
- Situation
	- Tutoring OOP at UNSW. I noticed after my first tutorial that students did not feel engaged, and had not completely learnt all the content I had covered in class. I also felt that the given resources were not the best examples of using OOP, and it wasn't clear why a more complicated OOP solution would be used over if or switch statements.
- Task
	- Even though I had run my tutorial as was taught to me in training sessions, I felt that I was not satisfied with my teaching, and I needed to engage my class my class more.
- Action
	- For the following weeks, I researched the patterns I would teach, and found ways of teaching I felt were easier to understand, and more intuitively lead to the desired pattern. I wanted my students to feel like they were discovering the pattern themselves.
	- One example was teaching the decorator pattern. I implemented a armour system for minecraft with many code smells. 
	- Tutorials become much more interactive. I would present a engaging situation and ask students questions like "what is the problem here?" and "how can this be improved"?
